We do this every 6 months but this one was very special because we did a major renovation on our temple this time and the main temple was rebuilt. Our whole village went all the way down to the beach with all the pemangku riding together in the back of a pickup truck ringing their bells with a police escort. It was so much fun to spend time with family and community. In the night time we even had comedy and dance performances."

            This is all thanks to you and everyone who has supported us the last 5 years. We will be using this land to grow medicine and food for people with autoimmune disorders like cancer, diabetes, arthritis, food allergies, and digestive issues."

		  msg_p_1="Jero Tya's 102 year old grandmother passed away early morning April 17th, 2022. She was an inspiration for us. Born in the foothills of Mount Agung, she had a strong upbringing. She collected firewood in the forest every day until her death at 102 years old. 
            It was unique watching her always eating fresh food, picking leaves and using plants from the forest to prepare her meals. We learned so much from her and will never forget the power of her simple way of life connected to the source. When she passed there were others 
            in our village who had passed during the pandemic and the families didn't have the money to pay for the cremation and ceremony which can get very expensive. Jero Tya decided in an instant from her heart to donate enough to pay for the entire ceremony and cremation for her entire village.Now her lovely grandmother and the entire village are relaxed and at peace.This following photo is from the very last ceremony on the beach in Klungkung close to midnight after performing ceremonies starting 1am the previous morning. 
            It was a very long 24 hours and this is one of the final blessings to send Jero Tya's grandma and the others from our village to the correct place on the other side. 
            This is a transition for the dead and they need to know that we love them and are taking every precaution to get them to the other side with the utmost care and respect. 🙏"

		  msg_p_1="This photo is from a time when we met a woman with a very powerful and beautiful energy. When we walked up to her we started to feel very warm and blessed. As it turns out she is a very well known German healer by the name of Zara Kumara (or Za Rah). She was traveling through Bali for the Bali spirit festival. When we introduced ourselvs she was so ecstatic to meet Jero Tya and asked us if we could come to her room at Four Seasons to do a special blessing for her. We agreed and went there the next day after preparing many offerings. We felt very out of place being in such a fancy hotel for the first time. The staff drove us around in a golf cart and it was so exciting for us. Zara ordered us a beautiful fruit platter from room service. This marked the first time that someone showed us such warm hospitality and showed that they really valued us and cared for us. We haven't heard from her since then but we have a strong feeling we will meet again someday. Za Rah, if you are reading this... Call us! 😀"

		  msg_h1="Nevin & Jero Tya meet through yoga" 
		  msg_h2="October, 2016" 
		  msg_p_1="Nevin came to Bali to study yoga due to a back injury from a car accident. He was having trouble walking and was in extreme pain. After attending a yoga training every day for 
                  one month Nevin completely healed. In order to stay healthy he started volunteering at Suly resort in Ubud, teaching Balinese high school students yoga and philosophy. After two years
                  of volunteering all of the students graduated and Nevin started looking for a job. He applied to teach yoga at a new studio in Ubud and got the job immediately. Jero Tya was his manager.
                  They started dating and within 6 months Jero Tya and Nevin got married. Jero Tya would often join Nevin's classes but when she got pregnant she got too big
                  to do yoga and had to sit down at the front of the class. After the first day of sitting down she wanted to start bring some small things to make an altar. Slowly but surely the altar 
                  got bigger and bigger until they were bringing a motorbike full of statues, flowers, bells, a tibetan bowl, special fabrics, etc etc every day. The students loved it! People's hearts were really being touched
                  by the natural progression of this altar. Jero Tya started singing and reciting mantra during the class. People loved it even more. And this is how Jero Tya's blessing ceremonies were born. Since then they've performed these blessings for large yoga trainings, retreats, a huge 300 person event in Nusa Dua, and a private blessing for a United Nations meeting."
